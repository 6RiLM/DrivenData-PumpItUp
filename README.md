# DrivenData-PumpItUp

This repository contains R code for the [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](http://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/) competition on [Driven Data](http://www.drivendata.org).

The data is provided by [Taarifa](http://taarifa.org) and the [Tanzanian Ministry of Water](http://maji.go.tz). The goal is to predict whether a water pump is functional, functional but needs repairs or non functional.

I use [H2O](http://h2o.ai)'s random forest to get a score 0.8212. I will upload my best (current) submission but not the data. Sign up at Driven Data to download the following files:
